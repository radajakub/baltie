Programs in Baltie 3 programming language when I was 8-11 years old and just started programming.
Baltie 3 is an educational language which inspired MIT professors to create Scratch.

Unfortunately, the apps are in Czech language, because at the time I did not know English that well.

## Install
The Baltie 3 programming language is exclusively for the Windows operating system.
The instructions to install the language are here: [SGP SYSTEMS](https://sgpsys.com/en/Download.asp).
